			<p>Hi Guys! My name is Jacqueline Greavu. Last spring I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in marketing and digital studies. Since then I have moved out to Chicago where I am currently working for a marketing/advertising firm. 
			 
			This blog is a way for me to showcase my work and my passion with others. I have always loved photography, design, and all things digital and I hope you see that through my work. Enjoy!</p>
